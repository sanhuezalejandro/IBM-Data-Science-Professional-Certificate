shown above both decision tree models provide the same score on the test dataset. However Snap ML runs the training routine faster than Scikit-Learn. This is one of the advantages of using Snap ML: acceleration of training of classical machine learning models, such as linear and tree-based models. For more Snap ML examples, please visit https://github.com/IBM/snapml-examples. Moreover, as shown above, not only is Snap ML seemlessly accelerating scikit-learn applications, but the library's Python API is also compatible with scikit-learn metrics and data preprocessors.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"46c658c1-7ddd-4909-8806-9111702e9f6f","metadata":{},"source":["## Practice\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fb72a990-5486-4919-8e63-df70177b7736","metadata":{},"source":["Lets train a `SnapML` `Decision Tree Regressor` with the `max_depth` parameter set to `12`, `random_state` set to `45`, and `n_jobs` set to `4` and compare its Mean Squared Error to the decision tree regressor we trained previously\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"16de0b7b-f15a-4d45-9f6d-db6f248baee5","metadata":{},"source":["Start by creating and training the decision tree\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"025eeb4f-669d-4d51-b9e4-e15672389809","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7343e6a7-27f4-4672-a484-1b3e210462ed","metadata":{},"source":["<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>\n","\n","```python    \n","tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=12, random_state=45, n_jobs=4)\n","\n","tree.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9fdf13f9-44cb-4c4d-aad1-5927d8be7a78","metadata":{},"source":["Now calculate the Mean Squared Error on the test data\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2088afe7-9e64-41ac-8a59-86d46885d024","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fb844bdb-5794-4582-a035-67da6b7bcff7","metadata":{},"source":["<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>\n","\n","```python    \n","pred = tree.predict(X_test)\n","\n","print(\"MSE: \", mean_squared_error(y_test, pred))\n","\n","```\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"860e331b-7609-4455-be18-5b3b98cb8626","metadata":{},"source":["We learned that increasing the `max_depth` parameter to `12` increases the MSE\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"13f4a818-28b9-4ec8-b182-9a338c62a796","metadata":{},"source":["## Authors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7b2c099b-c841-464e-b97a-d0d0536fa592","metadata":{},"source":["Andreea Anghel\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e2152d4f-e7a4-4668-b038-1b28f9215bbc","metadata":{},"source":["### Other Contributors\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"507d7ccc-02f5-435b-871a-0ea8e0a34cec","metadata":{},"source":["Sangeeth Keeriyadath \n","\n","Joseph Santarcangelo\n","\n","Azim Hirjani\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f4392bd5-72e2-4e31-bb7d-de821d7c99b1","metadata":{},"source":["## Change Log\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"49429e6a-42b1-4470-836d-13ca20a32755","metadata":{},"source":["|  Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |  Version | Changed By  |  Change Description |\n","|---|---|---|---|\n","| 2021-08-31  | 0.1  | AAN  |  Created Lab Content |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"104853c8-3aef-4e66-b7d6-4e228d820a89","metadata":{},"source":[" Copyright &copy; 2021 IBM Corporation.
